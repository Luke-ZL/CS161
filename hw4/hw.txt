The graph contained in graph1.txt is unsatisfiable with 3 colors.
With 4 colors, it is satisfiable.

Commands used:
(graph-coloring-to-sat "graph1.txt" "sat1" 3)
(graph-coloring-to-sat "graph1.txt" "sat2" 4)
./rsat sat1
./rsat sat2

I observed in graph1.txt there is no node with a degree larger than 4: the max degree is exactly 4. A possible coloring is as follows(using red(r), green(g), blue(b), yellow(y)):
Node 1: R
Node 2: G
Node 3: B
Node 4: R
Node 5: B
Node 6: G
Node 7: Y

The graph contained in graph2.txt is satisfiable only when using 8 or more colors.
